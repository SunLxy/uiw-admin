## Getting started

Clone and install deps

git clone git@github.com:uiw-react/uiw-admin.git

cd uiw-admin
yarn
yarn start
```

Then open `http://localhost:1234` and edit `index.js` and press save. Parcel will automagically hot reload you files whenever you make changes.

This will compile your JS and copy your `index.html` to the dist folder which you can deploy whereever as as a good ol' webpage.
